Preprocessing folder is for preprocessing the scraped data.
"preprocessing.py" does all the NLP preprocessing and saves the processed data as "preprocessed_youtube_data.csv"

After preprocessing we label the data for creating a labelled dataset for classification so we move to "labelling"
subfolder in "ML" folder.
